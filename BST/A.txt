1. Basics:  insert, inorder, count, min, max, delete, leaf nodes ✅
2. SumEle,  ISBST, LCA, PrintPath,   ✅

pending: sumTree, DistBEtween2Nodes

3.Convert normal BSt to balanced Bst - inorder -> store nodes to array -> make BST again
  BST to GREATER sumTree 
  Convert BT to BSt - inorder, sort and replace nodes .
  Construct bst from preorder transversal-O(n)by storing min max limits
                                      -O(n^2) by making BST from pre
  Merge 2 BST= inorder both, merge them in sorted array and make bST.

4. Validate preorder valid or not.  ✅
    count pairs to give sum x.
    Find floor, ceil. 

5. Morris inorder+postorder transversal + Kth smallest
Median of bst in O(n) and O(1).
  Replace every element with least greater ele on its right.
  n appointments - find conflicting appointments
  largest bst in BST
  flatten BST to sorted list
  whether BST contains dead end.
